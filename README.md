Task 1: Movie Ticket Booking System

Objective: Use Math.random(), Math.ceil(), and loops to simulate a simple movie ticket booking system.

Instructions:

1. Ask the user to enter their name.
2. Display a list of available seats (1 to 30).
3. Generate a random seat number using Math.ceil(Math.random() * 30).
4. Assign the seat to the user and display:

Hello [User], your seat number is [Random Seat Number].

Task 2: Lucky Draw Program

Ask the user to enter their name.
Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
Print:
[User], your lucky number is [Random Number]

If the lucky number is 50, print "You won a special prize!".

Task 3: AI Love Calculator

Ask the user for two names (e.g., "John" & "Emma").

Generate a random compatibility score (1-100%) using Math.random().

Print:
Love Score for John & Emma: 78% ❤️
Add fun messages based on the score:
90-100% → "Perfect match! ❤️"
50-89% → "Good compatibility! 😊"
1-49% → "Maybe just friends! 😅"
